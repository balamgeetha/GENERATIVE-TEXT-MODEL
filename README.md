**Generative text models have transformed how machines understand and produce language. This project implements such a model, trained to predict and generate coherent sequences of text that follow the context and style of given input. The core technology involves transformer-based architectures, which excel at capturing long-range dependencies in text data.

This repository contains all the necessary code, data preprocessing utilities, and pretrained weights to get started quickly with text generation tasks. Whether you want to experiment with novel story writing, simulate conversations, or build content creation tools, this project provides a flexible foundation.

Features
Context-aware text generation: Produces meaningful and contextually relevant outputs from various input prompts.

Customizable: Allows fine-tuning on user-specific datasets to adapt the style or domain.

User-friendly API: Simple functions to generate text, customize output length, and control creativity through sampling parameters.

Pretrained models: Includes pretrained weights trained on a large corpus of text to jumpstart usage without lengthy training.

Support for multiple frameworks: Compatible with PyTorch and TensorFlow, with example scripts for both.

Technologies and Tools
Python: Main programming language for model implementation and scripting.

PyTorch / TensorFlow: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the model.

Transformers library (Hugging Face): Utilized for state-of-the-art transformer architectures like GPT, GPT-2, or similar.

Tokenizers: Efficient text tokenization to convert raw text into numerical format understood by the model.

CUDA: Optional GPU acceleration support to speed up training and inference**
